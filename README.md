# Cybersec Portfolio — bronson837

Welcome — this repo documents my hands-on cybersecurity labs, scripts, and short reports.  
I use Kali Linux for lab work and focus on web, network, and Linux fundamentals.

## Contents
- `labs/` — lab write-ups and reports (sanitized)
- `scripts/` — automation and recon scripts
- `scans/` — saved Nmap/gobuster outputs
- `notes/` — commands, cheat sheets, and study notes

## How to view
Each lab in `labs/` contains: date, time spent, tools used, steps taken, findings, and remediation notes.
